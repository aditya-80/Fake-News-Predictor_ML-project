According to the Clinical Trials website, run by the National Institutes of Health, participants must be at least 14 years old and 18-24 weeks pregnant.The controversial study, led by Bliss Kaneshiro, MD and Kate Whitehouse, DO, will monitor bleeding during D&E abortions to determine the effects of the drug oxytocin, commonly used to minimize blood loss and decrease the risk of hemorrhage.The clinical trial, called  Effects of Oxytocin on Bleeding Outcomes during Dilation and Evacuation  began in October 2014 and is a collaboration between UH, Society of Family Planning and the University of Washington.The Society of Family Planning funds a number of similar research projects, such as experimenting with the dosage of Misoprostol, a uterine contracting agent, prior to surgical abortions at 13-18 weeks and exploring umbilical cord injections to produce fetal death prior to late-term abortions.In the UH study, researchers will carry out a  randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trials,  to determine the effect of oxytocin s use on uterine bleeding, meaning that they will either provide or deny intravenous oxytocin to the women.Reports suggest that some doctors are concerned that withholding oxytocin during surgery may put patients, especially teen girls, at risk. This study is reminiscent of Nazi concentration camp experiments. I pity the poor women who are being treated like lab rats, especially those who are denied the drug to reduce hemorrhaging,  said Troy Newman, President of Operation Rescue.Dilation and evacuation abortions are surgical procedures that involve dismembering the pre-born baby with forceps, scraping the inside of the uterus with a curette to remove any residuals and finally suctioning out the womb to make sure the contents are completely removed.After the abortion, the corpse of the fetus is reassembled and examined to ensure everything was successfully removed and that the abortion was complete.The study is hoping to attract up to 166 test subjects and is expected to conclude in July 2015.Via: Breitbart News\",\n          \"CNN was quick to scoop up Corey Lewandowski after Donald Trump kicked him out of his role as campaign manager, but his first week on the job is going pretty much exactly how you would expect it to go   terribly.Not only has Lewandowski proven himself to be pretty much like a paid spokesman for Trump, but his defense of the disgraced GOP candidate isn t being received well. Earlier this week, Lewandowski revealed that he was under contract and couldn t criticize The Donald, even after being fired from the campaign. Today, Lewandowski got called out by Hillary Clinton surrogate Christine Quinn for hyping Trump up to be an expert on the Brexit decision   a suggestion that was clearly false.On Monday s edition of CNN s New Day, Lewandowski made another pathetic defense of Trump by trying to reframe the candidate s disgusting reaction to Brexit, where he mostly spoke about how much the decision would be good for his Scotland golf resort. Lewandowski s defense was: Obviously the U.S. dollar has become much stronger now against the British pound. If you re going to spend money in Europe, now would actually be a good time to go with the fall of the pound.What you have is a world view, so what you have is someone who is saying,  Let s look at this from the U.S. perspective. If you want to go and travel overseas   just from a monetary perspective   now is the right time to do that because what you re getting is more for your dollar. Quinn wasn t having it. She ripped into Lewandowski, firing back, Donald Trump is not running to be travel agent of the world, he s running to be president of the United States.  She continued: What he said wasn t a commentary on international markets, it was,  When the pound goes down, more people will come to my golf course. Donald Trump s main concern isn t the international markets, it isn t the impact that Brexit will have on hard working Americans  401Ks, it s himself. How can he make more money, how can he put more money in his bank account? Lewandowski compared the Brexit decision to Trump s rise in the GOP, and Quinn once again called him out and put him back in his place. She said: Trump touted that he saw this coming. That s ridiculous because when he was first asked about Brexit by the press, he didn t appear to know what it was. Lewandowski tried to counter by insisting that People are too smart, they are tired of being told what to do.  He then tried to commend Trump for being a selfish moron: You know what Donald Trump said about Brexit? What he said was, you don t have to listen to me because it s not my decision. He didn t weigh in like Hillary Clinton did, like Barack Obama did, saying that you can t do this. Quinn fought back, Because he didn t know what it was. Lewandowski was fighting a losing battle. Trump s reaction to Brexit was just as terrifying as it was humorous   it truly proved that Trump knows nothing about foreign affairs, and hasn t spent any time educating himself since the beginning of his presidential candidacy. If only some of the hours he spent getting into fights on Twitter were being used for learning about how the world works. But instead, he once again exposed himself as an unfit choice for President. And when people like Lewandowski try to make sense of his idiocy, they only make themselves look equally foolish.You can watch the embarrassing video below:Featured image via screen capture\",\n          \"A Michigan woman decided to defend against tyranny? when she and another shopper couldn t agree over who got to buy the last notebook on the shelf at the Novi Towne Center store.According to ABC 13, the brawl   yes, brawl    involved two Farmington Hills residents, ages 46 and 32, and a mother and daughter from South Lyon, ages 51 and 20. In other words, these were all grown adults who should have known better but hey   there was only one notebook on the shelf, and we ve all seen what happens in those post-apocalyptic movies when a store is down to the last gallon of milk, right?Two of the women, one of whom was the unnamed 20-year-old, reached for the notebook at the same time. The 46 and 32-year-olds apparently decided that she wasn t getting their goddamn notebook and began pulling her hair.Then, because this had almost hit peak  trailer park,  the 20-year-old s mother decided to go for bonus points by pulling out her gun. Fortunately, someone pushed her aside before she could do any harm.This is one of the NRA s  responsible gun owners  (conservatives can t dismiss this one, as it is confirmed that she is a concealed carry permit holder)   ready to leap into action at the most minor sign of danger and make things worse by turning the situation potentially deadly.Watch it happen below:Featured image via screengrab\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"subject\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 6,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"News\",\n          \"politics\",\n          \"Middle-east\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1681,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Jun 5, 2015\",\n          \"August 28, 2016\",\n          \"June 3, 2017\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":79}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Displaying sample records from the true news dataset\n","data_true.head()"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":379},"id":"6TyBwPS0YG3y","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1755956696448,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":479,"user":{"displayName":"Aditya Sonkusare","userId":"09907126363109667921"}},"outputId":"2b7312b2-0847-4f1d-a5d2-18f0e2456ee8"},"execution_count":80,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["                                               title  \\\n","0  As U.S. budget fight looms, Republicans flip t...   \n","1  U.S. military to accept transgender recruits o...   \n","2  Senior U.S. Republican senator: 'Let Mr. Muell...   \n","3  FBI Russia probe helped by Australian diplomat...   \n","4  Trump wants Postal Service to charge 'much mor...   \n","\n","                                                text       subject  \\\n","0  WASHINGTON (Reuters) -

The legislation would provide $36.5 billion in emergency relief as Puerto Rico in particular struggles to regain electricity and other basic services following destructive hurricanes. The House of Representatives approved the bill earlier this month. The Trump administration already has indicated it will seek another round of emergency relief from Congress. \",\n          \"BUDAPEST (Reuters) - About a thousand Hungarians protested on Friday against a crackdown on the main opposition party Jobbik which has been  threatened by a record political campaign fine that the party leader describes as a  death sentence  for democracy. Despite the gloomy rhetoric and Jobbik saying it was fighting for survival, support for the demonstration was well down on other similar rallies over the past year. Hungarians will vote for a new parliament in April and Prime Minister Viktor Orban s conservative, anti-migrant Fidesz party is far ahead in the polls, with Jobbik its nearest rival. Jobbik, once on the far right, has turned toward the center in a bid to attract more support and is now campaigning nationwide against Orban, depicting him as the leader of a criminal gang. Orban, rejecting the charges, says his financial standing is  an open book . Last week the state audit office (ASZ) ruled Jobbik had bought political posters far below market prices, breaching rules on political funding, then it slapped a 663 million forint ($2.5 million) penalty on the party. The protesters, waving Jobbik flags and posters deriding the ruling elite, gathered outside the headquarters of Orban s Fidesz party.  What we see unfolding is not an audit office investigation. It is not an official penalty. This is a death sentence with Jobbik s name on it. But in reality, it is a death sentence for Hungarian democracy,  Jobbiik leader Gabor Vona told the crowd. A government spokesman could not comment immediately on his remarks. ASZ chairman Laszlo Domokos is a former Fidesz lawmaker, whom Jobbik and other critics accuse of making decisions in favor of Orban. The audit office denies that. On Friday, ASZ again called on Jobbik to submit information that would challenge its findings, saying it acted fully within its rights throughout the probe. The ruling Fidesz party and the government have denied any involvement in the ASZ probe.  This case has nothing to do with the election campaign,  Orban aide Janos Lazar said on Thursday. For over a year Fidesz has targeted Jobbik, whose move to the center could upend the longstanding status quo of a dominant Fidesz with weaker opponents to its left and its right, said analyst Zoltan Novak at the Centre for Fair Political Analysis. Gyorgy Illes, a 67-year-old pensioner attending the rally, said he used to be a Socialist supporter but got disillusioned as the party struggled to overcome its internal divisions.  This ASZ probe is a clear sign that Orban is way past any remedy. It is a ruthless attack on everything we hold dear. Democracy, the rule of law, equality, you name it,  he said. \",\n          \"BEIJING/TAIPEI (Reuters) - China accused the United States on Thursday of interfering in its internal affairs and said it had lodged a complaint after U.S. President Donald Trump signed into law an act laying the groundwork for possible U.S. navy visits to self-ruled Taiwan. Tensions have risen in recent days after a senior Chinese diplomat threatened China would invade Taiwan if any U.S. warships made port visits to the island which China claims as its own territory. On Monday, Chinese jets carried out  island encirclement patrols  around Taiwan, with state media showing pictures of bombers with cruise missiles slung under their wings as they carried out the exercise. On Tuesday, Trump signed into law the National Defense Authorization Act for the 2018 fiscal year, which authorizes the possibility of mutual visits by navy vessels between Taiwan and the United States. Such visits would be the first since the United States ended formal diplomatic relations with Taiwan in 1979 and established ties with Beijing. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said while the Taiwan sections of the law were not legally binding, they seriously violate the  One China  policy and  constitute an interference in China s internal affairs .   China is resolutely opposed to this, and we have already lodged stern representations with the U.S. government,  Lu told a daily news briefing. China is firmly opposed to any official exchanges, military contact, or arms sales between Taiwan and the United States, he added.  Proudly democratic Taiwan has become increasingly concerned with the ramped up Chinese military presence, that has included several rounds of Chinese air force drills around the island in recent months.  Taiwan is confident of its defenses and responded quickly to the Chinese air force drills this week, its government said, denouncing the rise in China s military deployments as irresponsible. Taiwan presidential spokesman Alex Huang, speaking to Taiwan media in comments reported late on Wednesday, said the defense ministry had kept a close watch on the patrols and responded immediately and properly. Taiwan  can ensure there are no concerns at all about national security, and people can rest assured , Huang said. Both sides of the narrow Taiwan Strait, which separates Taiwan from its giant neighbor, have a responsibility to protect peace and stability, he added.  Such a raised military posture that may impact upon and harm regional peace and stability and cross-strait ties does not give a feeling of responsibility, and the international community does not look favorably upon this,  Huang was quoted as saying. Relations have soured considerably since Tsai Ing-wen, who leads Taiwan s independence-leaning Democratic Progressive Party, won presidential elections last year. China suspects Tsai wants to declare the island s formal independence, a red line for Beijing. Tsai says she wants to maintain peace with China but will defend Taiwan s security. Taiwan is well equipped with mostly U.S. weapons but has been pressing for more advanced equipment to deal with what it sees as a rising threat from China.

He met with representatives from the coal industry to sign a bill undoing Obama s coal mining rule. The people s president is a worker!OUR PREVIOUS REPORT ON SCOTT PRUITT S APPOINTMENT TO EPA CHIEF THE LEFT WENT BONKERS!OKLAHOMA ATTORNEY GENERAL SCOTT PRUITT is another perfect choice from President-elect Donald Trump. He s sued the feds several times for their overreach in regulations on the coal industry. You have to love his commitment to keeping the federal government on the straight and narrow. It s funny that so many of Trump s picks have gone against Obama s policies We love it! The lefty politicians in DC wasted no time tweeted out their displeasure:When the Environmental Protection Agency proposed rules regulating carbon dioxide emissions from coal-fired power plants, Scott Pruitt sued. When the Justice Department offered legal status to young undocumented immigrants, Scott Pruitt sued. And when the Obama administration sought to give tax credits to states that hadn t set up their own health insurance exchanges, Scott Pruitt sued.Since becoming Oklahoma attorney general in 2010, Pruitt has filed or joined lawsuits against federal agencies at least a dozen times. Even when Oklahoma isn t an actual party in litigation, the state often submits a legal brief against the federal government. Besides air pollution, immigration and health care, Pruitt has fought federal laws and regulations on banking, contraception and endangered species. These days, whenever states go to court against the Obama administration, the chances are that Pruitt is somehow involved.Not that Pruitt is alone. During Obama s presidency, the entire cadre of Republican attorneys general (27 at present) has coordinated cases against federal agencies at an unprecedented pace. But Pruitt is at the center of the action. He has set up a first-in-the-nation  federalism unit,  which seeks to combat instances of federal overreach by every possible means.Read more: Governing\",\n          \" (In this Oct. 13 story, corrects description of legal standard regarding Trump in paragraph 15) By Alison Frankel and Dan Levine (Reuters) - Donald Trump hasn\\u2019t sued a newspaper for libel in three decades, despite the Republican presidential nominee repeatedly threatening to do so over the course of his business career, according to databases of state and federal court records.  A lawyer for the New York real estate developer demanded on Wednesday The New York Times retract a story in which two women accused Trump of inappropriately touching them. If the newspaper did not comply, Trump, who says the allegations are fabricated, would \\u201cpursue all available actions and remedies,\\u201d the lawyer, Marc Kasowitz, said in a letter.  Trump said at a rally on Thursday he was preparing a lawsuit.  An attorney for the Times, David McCraw, said the story was of national importance and the paper would \\u201cwelcome the opportunity\\u201d to defend it in court. Over the years, media outlets including the Wall Street Journal, the Village Voice, the New York Post and Fortune Magazine have reported receiving similar threats from Trump or his representatives in advance of unflattering articles. However, Trump rarely makes good on those threats, according to a Reuters review of court dockets in the database of online legal research service Westlaw, a unit of Thomson Reuters.   \\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0 The last time he sued a news organization for libel was apparently in 1984. Trump filed the case after the Chicago Tribune\\u2019s architecture critic called his proposed 150-story Manhattan skyscraper an \\u201catrocious, ugly monstrosity.\\u201d In 1985, a federal judge in Manhattan dismissed the suit, ruling the critic had a First Amendment right to express his opinion. The skyscraper was never built. In the 32 years since Trump brought that suit, he has not taken similar action against another news organization, although he or his companies have sued at least three individuals and a book publisher. He was successful in one of those cases.  Book author and former New York Times reporter Timothy O\\u2019Brien defeated a Trump libel lawsuit in 2011, after Trump underwent a grueling deposition by O\\u2019Brien\\u2019s lawyers.  Trump\\u2019s suit against O\\u2019Brien, which also named O\\u2019Brien\\u2019s publisher, Time Warner Book Group, alleged the author deliberately underestimated the businessman\\u2019s net worth. A New Jersey state judge found in 2009 that Trump had not established O\\u2019Brien\\u2019s actual malice. \\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0 Former Miss Universe contestant Sheena Monnin was hit with a $5 million default judgment after she failed to appear for arbitration in a case in which Trump claimed she falsely denigrated the pageant as \\u201crigged.\\u201d The arbitration judgment was upheld by a federal judge in Manhattan in 2013. The court record indicates the judgment was paid in 2014. \\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0 The same year, a San Diego federal judge ruled Tarla Makaeff, who was lead plaintiff in a class action against Trump University, did not act with malice when she said in letters to her bank and the Better Business Bureau that Trump University engaged in fraudulent business practices. The judge, Gonzalo Curiel, dismissed Trump\\u2019s defamation claim. \\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0Trump\\u2019s attorneys, as well as a spokeswoman for his campaign, did not respond to requests for comment on his libel litigation record, including requests for information on any suits the Reuters docket search may have missed. \\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0U.S. courts have routinely deemed Trump a public figure in libel lawsuits. That means he has to show not only that the story is false, but also that the media outlet knew that it was false or published it in \\u201creckless disregard\\u201d for the truth. If Trump were a private person, he would have to show the paper was negligent in failing to learn the allegations were false, which is a lower standard of proof. The New York Times attorney, David McCraw, wrote that the paper carefully vetted the allegations in the story. Any Trump claim will be difficult because Trump\\u2019s accusers were on the record, said Jane Kirtley, a media law expert at University of Minnesota Law School. That would bolster the newspaper\\u2019s argument that it didn\\u2019t act recklessly in publishing their accounts. Trump has vowed to \\u201copen up our libel laws,\\u201d if he wins the presidency on Nov. 8, to make it easier to sue news organizations. In reality, he would not be able to unilaterally change the laws because they are generally governed by individual states and court precedents. Court records show that Trump or his businesses have themselves been sued several times for libel or defamation. Most of those suits, including a complaint by a former tenant of a Trump condominium and another by a former dealer at a Trump casino in Indiana, were dismissed. One defamation suit against Trump survived dismissal, however. Stock analyst Marvin Roffman sued Trump for $2 million in federal court in Philadelphia in 1990, claiming he was fired from his job after publicly predicting the failure of the Taj Mahal casino in Atlantic City. Roffman alleged Trump defamed him in critical statements to numerous newspapers and magazines. After a federal judge refused to toss the case, the Trump Organization settled in 1991. An attorney for Roffman declined to comment. \",\n          \"MOSCOW (Reuters) - British foreign minister Boris Johnson said on Friday that London could not ignore Russia s meddling in elections around the world, its actions in Ukraine, or the persecution of gay people in Chechnya.

The Permanent Court of Arbitration in June ruled that most of the Piran Bay area shared between the two neighbors was Slovenia s territorial waters, and that Slovenia should have a sea corridor through Croatian waters to international waters. The Hague-based court s six-month deadline for the states to implement the ruling expires on Dec. 29. Croatia rejects the  ruling, saying it withdrew from the process in 2015 because of Slovenia s violation of the arbitration procedure.  We intend to implement the ruling and expect Croatia to do the same,  Slovenian Prime Minister Miro Cerar said at a news conference following talks in Zagreb on Tuesday with his Croatian counterpart Andrej Plenkovic.  Slovenia will start the implementation where it can do it alone, and it will seek dialogue and cooperation from Croatia where it cannot act alone.  Plenkovic said the ruling was not obligatory for Croatia, which had withdrawn from the arbitration process after a leaked tape showed that a Slovenian judge on the arbitration panel had improperly exchanged confidential information with the Ljubljana government. The court acknowledged the arbitration violation but concluded that it was not serious enough to halt the case.   The issue of borders is an open issue for Croatia,  Plenkovic said, adding that Croatia had proposed to Slovenia a legal framework for new talks on the borders. Cerar dismissed the idea, saying the arbitration ruling was final for Slovenia. Plenkovic warned against  unilateral acts that could cause incidents on the borders .      The two countries have been arguing over their sea and land borders since both declared independence from former Yugoslavia in 1991 as it disintegrated and slid into war. The dispute held up Croatian accession to the EU for many years. Only after both parties agreed to arbitration was Zagreb granted entry to the bloc in 2013. The court ruled that Slovenia should have most of the Piran Bay area recognized as its territorial waters.  In addition, the tribunal established a 2.5 nautical mile-wide and some 10 nautical mile-long corridor through Croatian waters to give Slovenia much-coveted direct access to international waters. \",\n          \"People have called former President George W. Bush lots of things. War criminal. Worst President Ever. Terrorist. Dipshit. F*ckface. But it is doubtful that any African-American man, woman, or child (especially after his response to Hurricane Katrina) would ever call him  my nigga. While Republicans are understandably confused by Larry Wilmore s term of endearment for the President at the Correspondents  Dinner   after all, they are used to calling him the  -er  variation of the word rather than the one Wilmore used   many view Wilmore s ability to infuriate the right in this manner as the only redeeming aspect of his otherwise godawful comedy routine. So, Mr. President, I m going to keep it a hundred. Yo Barry, you did it, my n*gga,  Wilmore said at the dinner, a phrase that most recognized as a positive remark but the Right felt was a reminder of that  n-word  thing they don t get to use when referencing President Obama.Upon hearing Wilmore call the President  my nigga,  Fox host Todd Starnes, for example, nearly exploded into a noxious cloud of rage and envy after hearing Wilmore use a variation of something that he s been screaming inside his head for years as he pretended that Wilmore s words were somehow offensive. Sharing in Starnes  feigned outrage is conservative talk show host and imbecile Jimmy Mathis, who threw an almost temper tantrum on Sunday over Wilmore s ability to use the word.Suddenly, for the first time in his presidency, Mathis feels that Barack Obama deserves  respect.  That s   the jealousy felt by the Stupid Part of America that is so pervasive that they are now talking about  respecting this President   the same one they have been screaming about for years.Mathis said that public figures like Wilmore (and, presumably, Fox News hosts and other noted right-wing icons) should   go above and beyond to try to be as respectful to the individual and the office as possible    a complete departure from what typically happens in conservative media. Mathis whined that no one called President George W. Bush  my nigga : And then you have Larry Wilmore Correct me if I m wrong, I don t remember anybody while roasting [President George Bush] dropped the N-word in the final White House Correspondents Dinner.If I were President Obama, I would have walked off that stage, I would have walked off. No way you re going to disrespect me and the office. This is not a P.C. society thing. I can t imagine standing feet from the President of the United States and saying that,  Mathis said, though like all conservatives it s probably something that is a commonly recurring theme in his dreams.Here s a thought for Mathis: right now, at this very moment in time, the Republican frontrunner is endorsed by the KKK. Until you condemn that, the rest of us   especially people you regularly dismissively call  the blacks  or worse   don t give a damn what you think about a black man saying  my nigga. Listen to his feigned outrage below, with a bonus caller who says a bunch of racist stuff Mathis accepts without question:Featured image via screengrab\",\n          \"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - White House legislative director Marc Short said he expects Congress to pass a short-term spending bill to fund the federal government at least into January, he told CNBC in an interview on Monday, days before current funding expires on Friday.  \\u201cI don\\u2019t think anybody wants to see government shut down,\\u201d Short told CNBC. \\u201cWe\\u2019re very optimistic that we\\u2019re going to find a resolution this week.\\u201d \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"class\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1,\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":93}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["data.reset_index(inplace=True)\n","data.drop(['index'], axis=1, inplace=True)"],"metadata":{"id":"LzAAkhDUafFe","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1755956698352,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":16,"user":{"displayName":"Aditya Sonkusare","userId":"09907126363109667921"}}},"execution_count":94,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["data.columns"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"s01LI-6KafCC","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1755956698363,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":24,"user":{"displayName":"Aditya Sonkusare","userId":"09907126363109667921"}},"outputId":"4dcb5fcc-2291-43c5-ee6c-4fa2572964b7"},"execution_count":95,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["Index(['text', 'class'], dtype='object')"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":95}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["data.head()"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":206},"id":"nccHmKmrae_j","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1755956699220,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":855,"user":{"displayName":"Aditya Sonkusare","userId":"09907126363109667921"}},"outputId":"50af02a9-91dc-4605-eca7-c7da050945ad"},"execution_count":96,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["                                                text  class\n","0  The Anheuser-Busch Brewery put beer production...      0\n","1  WASHINGTON (Reuters) -

The Permanent Court of Arbitration in June ruled that most of the Piran Bay area shared between the two neighbors was Slovenia s territorial waters, and that Slovenia should have a sea corridor through Croatian waters to international waters. The Hague-based court s six-month deadline for the states to implement the ruling expires on Dec. 29. Croatia rejects the  ruling, saying it withdrew from the process in 2015 because of Slovenia s violation of the arbitration procedure.  We intend to implement the ruling and expect Croatia to do the same,  Slovenian Prime Minister Miro Cerar said at a news conference following talks in Zagreb on Tuesday with his Croatian counterpart Andrej Plenkovic.  Slovenia will start the implementation where it can do it alone, and it will seek dialogue and cooperation from Croatia where it cannot act alone.  Plenkovic said the ruling was not obligatory for Croatia, which had withdrawn from the arbitration process after a leaked tape showed that a Slovenian judge on the arbitration panel had improperly exchanged confidential information with the Ljubljana government. The court acknowledged the arbitration violation but concluded that it was not serious enough to halt the case.   The issue of borders is an open issue for Croatia,  Plenkovic said, adding that Croatia had proposed to Slovenia a legal framework for new talks on the borders. Cerar dismissed the idea, saying the arbitration ruling was final for Slovenia. Plenkovic warned against  unilateral acts that could cause incidents on the borders .      The two countries have been arguing over their sea and land borders since both declared independence from former Yugoslavia in 1991 as it disintegrated and slid into war. The dispute held up Croatian accession to the EU for many years. Only after both parties agreed to arbitration was Zagreb granted entry to the bloc in 2013. The court ruled that Slovenia should have most of the Piran Bay area recognized as its territorial waters.  In addition, the tribunal established a 2.5 nautical mile-wide and some 10 nautical mile-long corridor through Croatian waters to give Slovenia much-coveted direct access to international waters. \",\n          \"People have called former President George W. Bush lots of things. War criminal. Worst President Ever. Terrorist. Dipshit. F*ckface. But it is doubtful that any African-American man, woman, or child (especially after his response to Hurricane Katrina) would ever call him  my nigga. While Republicans are understandably confused by Larry Wilmore s term of endearment for the President at the Correspondents  Dinner   after all, they are used to calling him the  -er  variation of the word rather than the one Wilmore used   many view Wilmore s ability to infuriate the right in this manner as the only redeeming aspect of his otherwise godawful comedy routine. So, Mr. President, I m going to keep it a hundred. Yo Barry, you did it, my n*gga,  Wilmore said at the dinner, a phrase that most recognized as a positive remark but the Right felt was a reminder of that  n-word  thing they don t get to use when referencing President Obama.Upon hearing Wilmore call the President  my nigga,  Fox host Todd Starnes, for example, nearly exploded into a noxious cloud of rage and envy after hearing Wilmore use a variation of something that he s been screaming inside his head for years as he pretended that Wilmore s words were somehow offensive. Sharing in Starnes  feigned outrage is conservative talk show host and imbecile Jimmy Mathis, who threw an almost temper tantrum on Sunday over Wilmore s ability to use the word.Suddenly, for the first time in his presidency, Mathis feels that Barack Obama deserves  respect.  That s   the jealousy felt by the Stupid Part of America that is so pervasive that they are now talking about  respecting this President   the same one they have been screaming about for years.Mathis said that public figures like Wilmore (and, presumably, Fox News hosts and other noted right-wing icons) should   go above and beyond to try to be as respectful to the individual and the office as possible    a complete departure from what typically happens in conservative media. Mathis whined that no one called President George W. Bush  my nigga : And then you have Larry Wilmore Correct me if I m wrong, I don t remember anybody while roasting [President George Bush] dropped the N-word in the final White House Correspondents Dinner.If I were President Obama, I would have walked off that stage, I would have walked off. No way you re going to disrespect me and the office. This is not a P.C. society thing. I can t imagine standing feet from the President of the United States and saying that,  Mathis said, though like all conservatives it s probably something that is a commonly recurring theme in his dreams.Here s a thought for Mathis: right now, at this very moment in time, the Republican frontrunner is endorsed by the KKK. Until you condemn that, the rest of us   especially people you regularly dismissively call  the blacks  or worse   don t give a damn what you think about a black man saying  my nigga. Listen to his feigned outrage below, with a bonus caller who says a bunch of racist stuff Mathis accepts without question:Featured image via screengrab\",\n          \"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - White

considering a Boeing proposal to supply Ukraine with cheap, small precision bombs fitted to abundantly available rockets, allowing Kyiv to strike far behind Russian lines, according to a Reuters report. US and allied military inventories are shrinking, and Ukraine faces an increasing need for more sophisticated weapons as the war drags on. Boeing's proposed system, dubbed Ground-Launched Small Diameter Bomb (GLSDB), is one of about a half-dozen plans for getting new munitions into production for Ukraine and America's eastern European allies, industry sources told the news agency. GLSDB could be delivered as early as spring 2023, according to a document reviewed by Reuters and three people familiar with the plan. It combines the GBU-39 Small Diameter Bomb (SDB) with the M26 rocket motor, both of which are common in US inventories. Although a handful of GLSDB units have already been made, there are many logistical obstacles to formal procurement. The Boeing plan requires a price discovery waiver, exempting the contractor from an in-depth review that ensures the Pentagon is getting the best deal possible. Any arrangement would also require at least six suppliers to expedite shipments of their parts and services to produce the weapon quickly. Although the US has rebuffed requests for the 185-mile (297km) range Atacms missile, the GLSDB's 94-mile (150km) range would allow Ukraine to hit valuable military targets that have been out of reach and help it continue pressing its counterattacks by disrupting Russian rear areas. GLSDB is made jointly by Saab AB and Boeing Co and has been in development since 2019, well before the invasion, which Russia calls a \"special operation\". In October, SAAB chief executive Micael Johansson said of the GLSDB: \"We are imminently shortly expecting contracts on that.” According to the document - a Boeing proposal to US European - has small, folding wings that allow it to glide more than 100km if dropped from an aircraft and targets as small as 3ft in diameter.\n","\n","Predictions for the given news:\n","Logistic Regression: Not A Fake News\n","Decision Tree: Not A Fake News\n","Gradient Boosting: Not A Fake News\n","Random Forest: Not A Fake News\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["news = str(input())\n","manual_testing(news)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"LuLGfqLY2oPR","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1755957555648,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":19786,"user":{"displayName":"Aditya Sonkusare","userId":"09907126363109667921"}},"outputId":"cf9bdf55-2fae-4b9e-ca2c-1cd34361fc07"},"execution_count":120,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Pro-Russian users have often repeated the Kremlin’s original position that the invasion of Ukraine is a “special military operation” to “denazify” and “demilitarise” a “Neo-Nazi state”. Many have downplayed allegations of Russian war crimes or even claimed that the war is a supposed “hoax”. In one widely shared video, a news reporter could be seen standing in front of lines of body bags, one of which was moving. However, the footage did not show invented war casualties in Ukraine, but a “Fridays for Future” climate change protest in Vienna in February, three weeks before the invasion began. Days later, another viral video of a mannequin claimed to be proof that Ukrainian authorities had “staged” the mass killing of civilians in the town of Bucha. The misleading clip showed a prosthetic doll being dressed and prepared by two men. Nadezhda, an assistant director for a Russian television programme, confirmed to Euronews that the video showed their film set near St. Petersburg and not Ukrainian military personnel. “The information being given [to Russian citizens] is one-sided, it has nothing to do with reality, it is as badly done as any fake,” she told Euronews. Euronews The mannequin was being prepared for a television scene in Vsevolozhsk in Russia’s Leningrad region. Euronews Other examples of Ukraine war misinformation have centred on “crisis actors” – people who are supposedly hired to act out the role of terrified or deceased war victims. One false claim suggested that a well-known beauty blogger had “acted” as the pregnant victim of a deadly attack on a maternity hospital in the city of Mariupol on 9 March. Russia has shifted its stance on the attack, accusing Ukrainian Azov nationalists of staging a “hoax” bombing at a “non-operational” hospital. Its unfounded claims were later removed by both Facebook and Twitter.\n","\n","Predictions for the given news:\n","Logistic Regression: Fake News\n","Decision Tree: Fake News\n","Gradient Boosting: Fake News\n","Random Forest: Fake News\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Some Limitations\n","\n","The model is trained on a specific dataset of news articles that may not fully capture the diversity and nuances of real-world news, especially social media posts.\n","\n","Text preprocessing is relatively basic; slang, sarcasm, and contextual nuances might not be effectively handled.\n","\n","Models may be biased towards patterns learned from the training data, limiting generalization to unseen topics or styles."],"metadata":{"id":"2x5H42_wKgaC"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Future Improvements\n","\n","Incorporate advanced NLP techniques such as word embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe) or transformer models (BERT) to capture deeper semantic information.\n","\n","Expand preprocessing to handle social media-specific text features like hashtags, emojis, and abbreviations.\n","\n","Apply extensive hyperparameter tuning and ensemble methods to boost classification performance."],"metadata":{"id":"uWpueuUkKvse"}}]}
